# My Animal Crossing Dodo Codes App

This project is created using React and Firebase to upload codes into a chatroom-styled app. It has a safe Google Auth for signing in using your gmail account.

### Styling

I styled it using basic CSS but I plan to keep improving using more variable-based CSS including SASS.

## How to use:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

The node version needs to be downgraded before this can run properly.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
